🚀 *Project Overview*

This project showcases a complete business intelligence solution developed using Power BI to analyze a sales dataset from a grocery company, BlinkIT. The primary objective was to leverage Power BI's capabilities to perform a detailed analysis of sales performance, customer ratings, and product dynamics. The final product is an interactive dashboard that allows for easy exploration of key business metrics and trends.

📊 Dataset
The project utilizes the BlinkIT Grocery Data.xlsx - BlinkIT Grocery Data.csv dataset which includes detailed information on individual sales transactions. Key columns in the dataset include:
- Item Fat Content
- Item Type
- Outlet Establishment Year
- Outlet Location Type
- Outlet Size
- Outlet Type
- Item Visibility
- Item Weight
- Sales
- Rating
🔨 How I Built It
📺 Learning Source
I followed a YouTube tutorial to understand the fundamentals of Power BI, including:
- Data import and transformation using Power Query
- Creating relationships between tables
- Designing interactive visuals
- Using DAX for calculated columns and measures
🧩 Data Modeling
- Cleaned and transformed raw data using Power Query Editor
- Created relationships between outlet data, item types, and sales figures
- Used calculated fields to derive metrics like average sales, total sales, and item visibility
📐 Dashboard Design
I focused on clarity and storytelling:
- Bar charts to compare outlet types and item categories
- Pie charts to show fat content distribution across tiers
- Line charts to visualize outlet establishment trends over time
- Cards and KPIs for quick insights like total sales ($1.20M), average ratings (3.9), and item count
🔍 Key Insights
🏬 Outlet Performance
- Supermarket Type 1 dominates with over $787K in total sales and 5,577 items.
- Grocery Stores have the highest item visibility (113.57), indicating better product placement.
🌍 Location-Based Trends
- Tier 3 cities lead in sales ($472K), followed by Tier 2 and Tier 1.
- Outlet establishment has grown steadily from 2012 to 2022.
🍽️ Product Analysis
- Top-selling categories include Fruits & Vegetables, Snack Foods, and Household Items.
- Low Fat items outperform regular ones in Tier 3 and Tier 2 locations.
🚀 Next Steps
I plan to explore more real-world datasets and build dashboards that combine business intelligence with predictive analytics. I’m also diving deeper into DAX and Power BI service deployment.

🙌 Acknowledgment
This project was inspired by a YouTube tutorial[@Data Tutorials] that helped me grasp the basics of Power BI. I added my own analysis and design elements to make it more insightful.
